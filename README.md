# Infrastructure specifications
This modular Terraform script will create and deploy specified cloud infrastructure. There will be a VPC module, a Security Group module, and an EC2 module. Inside of the VPC module, in AWS Region us-east-1, a new VPC (VPC-A) with the address space 192.168.0.0/16 will be deployed. Inside of this VPC space, four public subnets (SN-01, SN-02, SN-03, SN-04) will be created, each receiving one EC2 instance (VM1, VM2, VM3, VM4). An Internet Gateway (igw) will allow the VPC to communicate with the internet. The VPC module (producer) will deliver outputs (VPC ID + Subnet IDs) to the SG and EC2 modules (consumers). Inside of the Security Group module, a new Security Group (sg-tf) will be created, allowing SSH, HTTP, and the two Docker containers' HTTP ports. The EC2 module will be responsible for creating EC2 instances, which will run a default website on port 80 and two Docker NGINX containers on ports 8080 and 8081.
